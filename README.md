GAMEPLAY

HUE bulbs blink once users join. 
Once minimum users (at the moment 3) has been filled in, a random colour will be displayed for 2 seconds.
After that the test starts,  memory and reaction of users are tested. 
For first level the application cycles through a random list of colours and at some point will show the same colour as in the beginning.
Users need to recognize that is the same colour and need to tap on their devices to get the highest score based on their sped of reaction.
Once all users have taped a leaderboard is shown based on who was the fastest.
