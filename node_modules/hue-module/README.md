# Node Hue Module

This is a node.js client library for the [Philips Hue](http://www.meethue.com).


## Installation

	npm install hue-module

## Usage

In order to use the hue.js library, you will need to know the IP address of the
hue base station.  You can find this through the
[meethue dashboard](http://www.meethue.com/) or using arp.  To use arp, note the
MAC address of the device (written on the bottom of the base station) and then
issue the `arp -a` command from your terminal.

    var hue = require('hue');
    
    hue.load("IP Address", "Username/Key");

    hue.lights(function(lights){
		for(i in lights)
			if(lights.hasOwnProperty(i))
				hue.change(lights[i].set({"on": true, "rgb":[0,255,255]}));
	});

At the moment there is no way to discover a base station or register with it. This is coming soon.
